## Information

The Hierarchically Deterministic (HD) wallets are the commonly used address generation mechanism for Olympus protocol.
This implementation has many advantages from only public/private key pairs.

This implementation is inherited from the Bitcoin Core Developers and modified for the Olympus Protocol.

Since Olympus uses a different cryptographic proof mechanism, the HD wallets standard differs a little from the original creation.

To get more information about how Olympus generates and uses HD wallets, please refer to the following documents:
1. Bitcoin BIP32: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki
2. Chia BLS HD wallets guidelines: https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures/blob/master/SPEC.md#hd-keys

## Path levels

As defined on `BIP44` for HD wallets there is a standard for Path levels to derive addresses.

As Olympus extends the address types with the following schemes:

### Standard path levels

```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account
```
